            Hi, my name is Armaan Kakkar. At the moment I am fourteen years old and am learning how to code. Coding helps me express my imagination to others to let them see how I view the world! Other hobbiess and passions I have include guitar, soccer, tennis and of course gaming! Now that I know the basics of code I see the world differently and wonder how each technology is built and what code is used. By now I have made a few games and the website you are viewing currently. Coding languages I have learned include JavaScript, HTML, CSS and I am learning JSX currently. I hope you enjoy my first website and have a great day!
